# Chop Shop
## What is it?

It can be hard to keep track of all the issues that can come up when working on a project car. The fundemental idea of chop shop is to give users an elegant, simple way to keep track of existing issues with their vehicle.

This project will be developed as a full MERN app with database endpoints handled on a seperate repo.

Initial use of chop shop will require the user to add a car, providing the year, make, and model, along with the engine and trim style (may create a dataset of car information to make this process less input heavy). After which they will be able to create issue tickets for that car, providing a short description as the title, followed by a full description. These descriptions will be connected to a custom GPT agent to give diagnostic recommendations.
